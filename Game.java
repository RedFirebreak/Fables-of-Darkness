 * This class is the main class of the "World of Zuul" application. "World of
 * Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users can walk around some
 * scenery. That's all. It should really be extended to make it more
 * interesting!
 * 
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * method.
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all rooms,
 * creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates and executes the
 * commands that the parser returns.
